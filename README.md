# Tetris
**By:** Bryce Bernstein

## Inspired by Tetris released for the NES, made for enrichment.

## Project Details:
### Usage:
- Pull code from GitHub
- Run using IDE run command or navigating to src directory in a terminal and running ```javac App.java``` then ```java App```

### What I learned:
- Developing GUI using Java Swing
- Style Constants
- Use of arrays in more than three dimensions

### How I hope to use this project:
- Development of a Tetris playing computer using reinforcement learning
- Additional modifications to create my own spin on the classic game

### To implement:
