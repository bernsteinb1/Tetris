# Tetris
**By:** Bryce Bernstein

## Inspired by Tetris released for the NES, made for enrichment.

### What I learned:
- Developing GUI using Java Swing
- Style Constants
- Use of arrays in more than three dimensions

### How I hope to use this project:
- Development of a Tetris playing computer using reinforcement learning
- Additional modifications to create my own spin on the classic game
